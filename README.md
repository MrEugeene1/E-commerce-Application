# ABOUT PROJECT
The E-Commerce Application is a Java-based project that simulates a simple online 
shopping platform. It enables users to perform essential e-commerce activities such as 
signing up, logging in, viewing and managing products, adding items to a shopping cart, and 
processing payments. This application was designed using an object-oriented programming 
approach in Java, focusing on modeling real-world e-commerce interactions. 
The project has evolved over time, incorporating new features and refinements aimed at 
improving user experience, extending functionalities, and ensuring data consistency. 
Several interfaces were added to enforce consistency and decouple functionalities. Overall, 
the application serves as a functional demonstration of building a simple e-commerce 
system using Java's core features.
